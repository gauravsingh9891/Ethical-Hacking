# Various steps of information Gathering
===========================================

(i).   Website footprinting.
(ii).  E-mail footprinting.
(iii). Footprinting throught search engine.
(iv).  DNS footprinting.
(v).   Network footprinting.
(vi).  People search online service (Zaba search, Zoominfo, People search, Peekyou, Intelius, People smart, While Pages, Yellow pages) etc.
(vii). Footprinting through social networking sites (Facebook,linkedin, Google, Twitter etc.).
